# Bank-Loan-Report-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
In Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Interactive Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Interactive Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
## Project Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1.	 Total Loan Applications: This analyse total number of loan applications received during a specified period.
2.	 Total loan Amount: Total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial.

4.	 Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans.
5.	 Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health.

## debt-to-Income Ratio. This is help check the financial performance of the bank, lending activities and health of the bank loan activities.

## Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
To assess our lending performance, we will categorize loans as Good or Bad based on status criteria, Those under category loan status, "Fully Paid" and "Currrent" are "Good Loan" and while the "Charged off" Loan status regarded as Bad Loans". The Good loans are issued loans, that are fully paid and currently paying their installment on or before the end of term, while the bad loans referred to as charged off are those who owns certain amount yet to be paid.
From the  dashboard,  Good loans shows profitablity comapred to that of Bad loans. A funded amount of $370.2M was disbursed to 86.18% of Good loan appplicant, and payments recievied is $435.8M. WHile that of Bad loans leading to losses as a sum of $65.5M was funded to 13.82% of loan applicant and payments received $37.2M is decrease from the fund disbursed to loan applicant.
